# The Wingman Project

**NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH WINGMAN LABS (supplements business)**

## Overview
Venture capital model for influencer e-commerce. We build brands for influencers, take 51% equity, they market and become the face.

## Core Thesis
The hardest part of e-commerce is marketing. Influencers struggle to monetize. Solution: Build brands for them autonomously, leverage their audience.

## Model
1. Find high-engagement, high-growth influencers
2. Build professional e-commerce website + dropshipped products
3. Generate custom branded photos via AI
4. Cold outreach with FINISHED concept
5. Onboard, negotiate equity (51% us / 49% them)
6. Set up dropshipping logistics
7. Influencer promotes their "own" brand

## Location
