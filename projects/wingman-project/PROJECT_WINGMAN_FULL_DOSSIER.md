# THE WINGMAN PROJECT: FULL DOSSIER

## 1. MASTER BUSINESS PLAN
**The Wingman Project** is a venture studio that builds turnkey e-commerce brands for mid-tier influencers (100k-500k followers). We identify talent, build a fully operational brand (product + site + logistics) *before* contact, and partner on a 51/49 equity basis.

### The Problem
- **Influencers fail at business:** They are content creators, not supply chain managers.
- **Agencies are predatory:** They charge retainers without sharing risk.
- **Merch is dead:** Low-quality print-on-demand dilutes brand equity.

### The Solution: Reverse Venture Building
1. **Identify:** High-engagement creators in specific niches.
2. **Build:** Create brand identity + product + site in <48 hours.
3. **Pitch:** Send the *finished* site.
4. **Partner:** 51% Us (Ops) / 49% Them (Marketing).
